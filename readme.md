Deys wants a program that lets you enter your birthday and the program will tell you what day of the week it falls on.
Bonus for letting you pick what year.

Attempts
Tried to use calendar library but this did not seem to suit my needs.
Instead i will attempt to use datetime library.
SUCCESS!!!!
But our program is very ugly and kind of convoluted. Can we make it more user-friendly and pretty to look at?
